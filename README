NAME
    Getopt::Inherited - Handling inherited command-line options

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use base 'Getopt::Inherited';

        use constant GETOPT => qw(foo=s);
        my $app = __PACKAGE__->new;
        $app->do_getopt;

DESCRIPTION
    By subclassing this mixin class, your program gets the ability to
    inherit command-line option specifications. If you have several programs
    that share common code and common command-line options you don't want to
    have to write the command-line processing code again and again. Using
    this class you can abstract command-line options shared by your programs
    into a superclass from which your programs then inherit. Additionally,
    this class defines certain common command-line options itself.

    You can also define defaults for command-line options.

METHODS
  GETOPT
    This accessor, which is accumulated across the class hierarchy using
    Data::Inherited, is used to define command-line options in the same
    format as Getopt::Long expects. This class, Getopt::Inherited, itself
    defines the following options:

        use constant GETOPT =>
            (qw(help man logfile|log=s verbose|v+ version|V));

  GETOPT_DEFAULTS
    This accessor, which is also accumulated across the class hierarchy, can
    be used to define defaults for the options given in "GETOPT()". For
    example, to define a command-line option called <foo> which takes a
    string and to give it a default, you would use:

        use constant GETOPT => qw(foo=s);
        use constant GETOPT_DEFAULTS => (foo => 'my_default');

  opt
    This is a hash accessor per Class::Accessor::Complex in which the option
    hash is stored when it has been parsed and after default values have
    been applied.

  usage
    This method is called by "do_getopt()" after the command-line options
    have been processed with Getopt::Long's "GetOptions". It uses Pod::Usage
    to display help information if there was either an error during
    processing, or if the "--help" or "--man" options have been given.

  do_getopt
    Does the actual command-line processing. It accumulates the values of
    GETOPT() across the hierarchy, parses them, calls "usage()" if
    necessary, applies GETOPT_DEFAULTS(), then assigns the finished options
    hash to "opt()".
